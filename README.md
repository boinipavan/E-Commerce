# E-Commerce
I have spearheaded the development of a sophisticated e-commerce website leveraging Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. This comprehensive solution offers a seamless and intuitive shopping experience for users, featuring a modern and responsive user interface built with Angular's robust framework. Powered by Spring Boot, the backend ensures scalability, security, and efficient data processing, facilitating smooth interactions between the frontend and backend systems. With features such as user authentication, product catalog management, secure payment processing, and order tracking, this project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack development and my ability to deliver high-quality, production-ready applications.
